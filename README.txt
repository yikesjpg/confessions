THE AUTOMATION SCRIPT!!!!!
extract the executable somewhere obvious
when you want to start reviewing things, double-click and a terminal window will pop up
there should be instructions on-screen to tell you what to do
if you happen on a confession that you don't know what to do with (i.e. it's too controversial), you CANNOT (at the moment) skip past it. if you do, it'll never pop up in the queue again. discuss it or w/e first, then accept or reject (i might fix this later idk)
